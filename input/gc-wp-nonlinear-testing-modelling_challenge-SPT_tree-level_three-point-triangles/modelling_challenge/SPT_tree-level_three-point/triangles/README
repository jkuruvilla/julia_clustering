This folder contains the triangles from 0 - 160 Mpc/h with a binning of 1-2-5 Mpc/h

Triangles are in increasing order:

- r23 >= r13 >= r12 AND r23 < rMax

Only side combination that form a closed triangles are selected

The code to provide the triangle list is provided as well.
The files have been produced launching the code in this way.

python triangles.py --binSize 1 --output_file triangles_binSize_1.dat
python triangles.py --binSize 2 --output_file triangles_binSize_2.dat
python triangles.py --binSize 5 --output_file triangles_binSize_5.dat

Please refer to documentation in triangles.py for other possibilities
